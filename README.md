# 🛡️ PivotGuard-API

PivotGuard is a browser extension that helps you make educated decisions as you navigate the web. Instead of letting you unknowingly interact with sites collecting your data, PivotGuard alerts you to potential privacy concerns and recommends safe alternatives. You're in control. Understanding the risks, you can continue to your desired page, or pivot to a safer option.

Sites are added to the curated list when they are found to have violated their user’s privacy in some way. A site may violate its user’s privacy through their use of trackers, excessive permissions, invasive algorithms, poor encryption, vague policies, and more.

This is the backend application for this project. The frontend application can be found [here](https://github.com/KokonutGamer/pivot-guard).
