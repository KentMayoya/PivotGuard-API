# 🛡️ Pivot-API

This project was developed during [CougHacks](https://coughacks.io/), a 24-hour hackathon, where the primary theme was Privacy and Online Presence. The secondary theme was Hobbies and Interests.

Pivot! is a browser extension that helps you make educated decisions as you navigate the web. Instead of letting you unknowingly interact with sites that collect your data, Pivot! alerts you to potential privacy concerns and recommends safer alternatives. You're in control. Understanding the risks, you can continue to your desired page, or Pivot! to a safer option.

Sites are added to the curated list when they are found to have violated users' privacy in some way. A site may violate its users' privacy through their use of trackers, excessive permissions, invasive algorithms, poor encryption, vague policies, and more.

This is the backend application for this project. The frontend application can be found [here](https://github.com/KokonutGamer/pivot-guard).
